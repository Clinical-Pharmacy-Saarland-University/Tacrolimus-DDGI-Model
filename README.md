# Tacrolimus-DDGI-Model
Modeling of published clinical tacrolimus studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model for tacrolimus. The model was developed using published clinical studies and its predicted performance was evaluated within our DDGI network. The file "Tacrolimus-Model" contains simulations of the published clinical studies used during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation, please refer to [1]. Furthermore, the DD(G)I files contain simulations of published clinical DD(G)I studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the tacrolimus model regarding DD(G)Is with the CYP3A perpetrator drugs itraconazole, voriconazole, and rifampicin, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied itraconazole, voriconazole, and rifampicin models have been published previously [2-3].
